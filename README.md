## My process
I created the html markups using divs, img, and p elements. Then used css flexbox to style.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
Highlight was me using 100% instead of 100vh on the body and wondering while the container was not centered. I wont forget that soon.


### Continued development
Need to solidify my knowledge of flexbox, grids, and media queries.
